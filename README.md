# Machine Learning Problem Statements

## Problem Statement No. 1
**ML Classification: Decision Tree**  
**Dataset:** madfhantr.csv  

Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban, and rural areas.  
Customer first applies for a home loan and after that, the company validates the customer's eligibility for the loan.  
The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for the loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
